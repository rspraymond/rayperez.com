While these criticisms have some merit, there are strategies to mitigate these issues. For instance, the learning curve can be eased by gradually introducing NestJS into your projects, rather than trying to adopt it all at once. You can start by using NestJS for a small part of your application and then expand its usage as you become more comfortable with it. As for the boilerplate code, it's important to remember that this is a trade-off for the structure and maintainability that NestJS provides. The boilerplate can be reduced by using NestJS's CLI to generate code, and the perceived overhead can be offset by the productivity gains from having a well-organized codebase.
