const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\\n');
});
server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});`}

          <LazySyntaxHighlighter language='javascript'>
            {`// Example of using an npm package
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('App is listening on port 3000');
});`}
          </LazySyntaxHighlighter>
          <Typography paragraph>
            In this example, we're using the Express.js package, a popular web application framework
            for Node.js, to create a simple server.
